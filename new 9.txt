one question about customer associations. Why not to have a many to many (CustomersAssociation) as following with one composite pk instead of unique constraint in association type?Â 

CustomersAssociation
* customerOneId (FK to customer)
* customerTwoId (FK to customer)
* associationTypeId (FK to association)
PK(customer1Id, customer2Id, associationTypeId)

CustomersAssociation
* customerOneId (FK to customer)
* customerTwoId (FK to customer)
* associationTypeId (FK to association)
PK(customer1Id, customer2Id, associationTypeId)
